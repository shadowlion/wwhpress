        <p>The story of cancer is as individual as the person relating it. Artist and breast cancer survivor Behr here
          includes anecdotes from patients and recommendations from physicians and medical professionals in order to
          provide
          comfort and knowledge for those on the same journey. The plastic cradles used to immobilize patients during
          radiation therapy serve as Behr’s inspiration and the source of the book’s artwork. With questions patients
          and
          family members should be asking (and their answers) and a useful glossary. VERDICT: Beautifully designed, a
          worthwhile addition to patient health holdings.</p>

        <p>Critique: Informed and informative, thoughtful and thought-provoking, "Surviving Cancer: Our Voices &amp;
          Choices" is a compelling read and very highly recommended for the personal reading lists of patients, family
          members, and medical professionals dealing with the various issues imposed by a diagnosis of breast cancer.
          Thoroughly 'reader friendly' in tone, content, organization and presentation, "Surviving Cancer: Our Voices
          &amp;
          Choices" is a critically important and highly recommended addition to both community and academic library
          Health &
          Medicine reference collections. It should be noted that 20% of the profits from the sale of "Surviving Cancer:
          Our
          Voices &amp; Choices" are donated to cancer charity.</p>

        <p>I am so very impressed with the way the author has taken objects that represent nothing short of terror for
          most
          women and has transformed them into objects of beautiful art, and has further integrated them so poignantly
          with
          the transformations made by each person whose story we encounter. Beautifully done!</p>

        <p>Marion Behr manages to present what is a terrible situation in a clear, informative, and somehow beautiful
          and
          peaceful manner. I have already recommended this book to several people as it seems these days, everyone is
          touched by cancer. The book is as informative as it is visually stunning. Kudos to Ms. Behr on her efforts.

        <p>I was fortunate enough to see a preview copy of this book and couldn't be happier with the results. Marion
          Behr
          has assembled incredibly useful information for those who have recently been diagnosed with cancer and has
          managed
          to put it all together in a format that is both easy and interesting to read.</p>

        <p>She shares stories from dozens of survivors from various racial and demographic backgrounds and physicians
          who
          specialize in the treatment of cancer victims, as well as from organizations that provide support. And she has
          intermingled it with stunning photography of sculpture that she created after being diagnosed with breast
          cancer.
          This was a much needed publication that will, hopefully, ease the transition of many others who face cancer.

        <p>Just received your book. I am so very impressed. The art work the text colors fonts and info is all amazing.
          So
          absolutely professional looking. I would like to order a copy for our mammo area. How may I do that? Thank you
          so
          much for sending me a copy. You are such an inspiration and I congratulate you on your Monumental achievement.
          I
          also want to get copies for some of my friends and friends of friends who are or have suffered with breast
          cancer.
          The way you integrate the art and words is incredibly powerful.</p>

        <p>Marion, the books arrived yesterday and it is beautiful as well as being a wonderful resource for people
          diagnosed with cancer and for those caring for them. We will spread the word via our FB page and more. Thanks
          again for the opportunity to have CHN be a part of this endeavor and for all you do to help those diagnosed
