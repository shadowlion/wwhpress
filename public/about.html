    <p>We did it! <strong><em>Surviving Cancer: Our Voices and Choices</em></strong> (268 pages) is a source book
      written by 70 individuals who share their personal knowledge and expertise in the cancer process. Survivors,
      varying in age, provide insight into their individual experiences and choices. Dr. Kathleen Toomey, Medical
      Director of the Steeplechase Cancer Center, presents the concept of a &ldquo;Cancer Team&rdquo; of doctors and
      health care professionals, which is then reflected in the book. Each article adds a new voice.</p>
    <p>The cancer team&rsquo;s articles are arranged to correspond with the usual order of visits experienced by most
      cancer patients. The visits begin with the family physician, progress to the radiologist and her technician. Then
      we continue to hear from the oncologists, the surgeon, medical and radiation doctors, a reconstruction surgeon, a
      nurse practitioner, social workers and many other health care providers. Their information is interwoven with
      survivors&rsquo; narrations, often relating to the doctors&rsquo; comments, contributing to a subtle dialogue
      developed throughout the book; a gynecologist&rsquo;s article is followed by the narration of a survivor of
      ovarian cancer, whose life was likely saved by a gynecological examination. Another doctor writes about male
      breast cancer, which precedes the experiences of a man who survived breast cancer and that of another man whose
      growth turned out to be benign.</p>
    <p>Cancer organization leaders describe how their organizations benefit cancer patients and their loved ones. These
      articles follow narrations by survivors helped by the cancer organizations mentioned. Different organizations suit
      different personalities. Articles on research, clinical trials, financial assistance, as well as poetry relating
      to cancer experiences, are included in this compilation. Each voice and choice, discussed in this book, provides
      helpful information to ease a patient&rsquo;s path throughout their cancer journey.</p>
    <p>Twenty percent of the profits from the sale of the book will be given to cancer causes.</p>
    <h3 style="margin: 40px 0 20px 0;">How did this project start?</h3>
    <img style="float: right; margin-left: 30px; margin-bottom: 30px;" src="images/aboutimg1.jpg" alt="" />
    <p>My kids persuaded me to get that mammogram that showed a small cancer in my breast. After the initial fear
      subsided, our family searched to find out what to do next. The process was complicated and occasionally
      frustrating. Ultimately, a biopsy confirmed the need for a surgeon to remove the cancer and several lymph nodes.
      The sentinel node indicated it was a good thing that there had been an early mammogram. As a result, I wanted to
      motivate others to be aware of the importance of early detection&hellip; but how?</p>
    <p>Several months later, during my first radiation treatment, I noticed one side of the room was filled with
      cradles. They were piled on top of one another on shelves that covered an entire wall. This type of cradle, which
      is used to hold patients in place during their treatments, is molded to each individual. Therefore, it cannot be
      reused for another patient after the procedure is complete. I recycled these as armatures for sculptures that
      could help make others aware of the need for early detection.</p>
    <p>The illustrations in our book are photographs of some of these cradle sculptures that depict feelings or
      experiences, based on comments made by cancer patients. &ldquo;Jumping for Joy, (the treatment is over)&rdquo; was
      the ultimate goal for a journey which probably started with a fear. Many of us experienced some similar feelings.
    </p>
    <p>A complete series of sculptures was first shown at Steeplechase Cancer Center, Somerville , NJ, and then at The
      Center for Contemporary Art in Bedminster, N.J. The sculptures were then shown in other galleries to encourage
      conversation and early detection. The concept for compiling <strong><em>Surviving Cancer: Our Voices and
          Choices</em></strong> originated in a panel discussion on breast cancer held during the second show.</p>
    <img style="float: right; margin-left: 30px; margin-bottom: 30px;" src="images/aboutimg2.jpg" alt="" />
    <p>Four survivors and two doctors were on the panel. I was awestruck by those survivors. They were young,
      articulate, beautiful and anxious to provide information. The doctors shared facts that had taken me weeks to
      gather. After the presentation, questions and answers stimulated a very lively conversation between the panel and
      the audience. We discovered that many questions urgently needed answers, and that evening, the idea for a book
      with this type of interaction was born.</p>
    <p>The first five articles came from our panelists. Shortly thereafter, we circulated posters and flyers to gather
      more survivors&rsquo; articles. Survivors recommended doctors. Doctors recommended other doctors. The circle
      widened quickly and now, at last, we have our book! More important, if you are faced with cancer &ldquo;Surviving
      Cancer: Our Voices and Choices is addressed to you.</p>

    <p>Marion R. Behr is an experienced publisher, writer and artist and is the compiler of <em><strong>Surviving
          Cancer: Our Voices &amp; Choices</strong></em>, as well as the owner of WWH Press LLC.</p>
    <p>Marion created the first national survey of women working from home in the 1970's and after receiving thousands
      of responses from women, she originated the concept of the <em>Homebased Business</em>, as opposed to the
      <em>cottage industry</em>, and formed Women Working Home Inc. with Wendy Lazar, a co- graduate from Syracuse
      University. Marion and Wendy co-authored two editions of <strong><em>Women Working Home: The Homebased Business
          Guide and Directory </em></strong> and sold fifty thousand copies.
    </p>
    <p>Marion later received a Presidential Appointment to The White House Conference on Small Business and her
      presentations to the US Labor Department and Senate helped to change laws on home based businesses.</p>
    <p>Marion and her husband Omri co-invented a non toxic etching process, which replaces acid but incorporates all the
      traditional etching methods. This process, patented as <a style="color: #e23117;"
        href="http://www.electroetch.com">Electroetch</a>, is now in many universities including Stanford, Juneau,
      Fairbanks and Syracuse, and in studios internationally.</p>
    <p>Marion is also involved in sculpting and painting and runs an art only blog <a style="color: #e23117;"
        href="http://mysynes.typepad.com">MyLyne</a> with the goal of establishing text free communication by using
      drawing as an international language.</p>
